This folder contains an example graph layout, the result of SORDID algorithm with the default parameter values proposed, and a python noebook to visualize them. 

SORDID and SORDID' results are pre-generated on the *badvoro* graph from **Graphviz** dataset with star shapes.

This code was tested with Python 3.8.17 and with the following libraries:
* Jupyter v1.0.0
* Numpy v1.24.3
* Matplotlib v3.7.3

The following command will install the latest version of the three libraries, installing the same versions is at your own discretion:
